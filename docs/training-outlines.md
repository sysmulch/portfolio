## Initial Steps Toward Scientific Writing for Publication &mdash; An 8-week Course

I will soon be teaching an 8-week course for engineering students at Kyushu University in Japan. The goal of the course is to give the students a broad understanding of scientific writing for publication so that they are prepared for graduate school.

## Research Writing &mdash; A 2-day Workshop

In 2020, I designed and facilitated a 2-day writing workshop in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, for African researchers funded by the International Science Council (ISC). The researchers were connected to ISC's *Leading Integrated Research for Agenda 2030 in Africa* program, and they were especially interested in identifying journals for their transdisciplinary work.
