# E-learning Elements

## A Unit on Research Ethics

The AuthorAID online course in research writing is the flagship course offered by INASP, with thousands of learners taking the course every year. I developed the course on INASP's LMS (learning management system) with a mix of instructional resources and learning activities. For example, in the second unit of this course, participants learn about research ethics by going through instructional resources, taking a quiz, sharing their reflections on ethics, and giving peer feedback on others' reflections. Participants can also interact with each other on a discussion forum.

### Interactive Learning Resource

To develop the instructional resources in the course, I used an authoring tool called H5P. I like to use many of the interactive content types that are built into H5P, such as "single-choice set," a set of questions that are shown one by one to the learner. In one of the resources in the research ethics unit, I created a single-choice set of questions about ethical violations in research. Here is a screencast showing the user experience:

## LMS Dashboard

As the site administrator of INASP's LMS, I designed a dashboard that users would see upon signing in. This LMS is built with the open source Moodle application, and I had to work with the features and constraints of this application. I also wanted to keep the dashboard simple enough and relevant enough for the 100K users on the site. So this is what I added:

- An Upcoming Events block to alert users to any upcoming events or deadlines
- A custom HTML block with a few tips for users
- Visual links to add some color to the page
