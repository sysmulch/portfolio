# E-learning Elements

## Online Course in Scientific Writing

When I was affiliated with INASP, an international development organization, I developed and maintained an online course in scientific writing for many years. I developed this course with a mix of instructional resources and learning activities. For example, in the second unit of this course, participants learn about research ethics by going through instructional resources, taking a quiz, sharing their reflections on ethics, and giving peer feedback on others' reflections. Participants can also interact with each other on a discussion forum.

## LMS Dashboard

When I was the site administrator of INASP's LMS (learning management system), I designed a dashboard that users would see upon signing in. This LMS is built with the open source Moodle application, and I had to work with the features and constraints of this application. I also wanted to keep the dashboard simple enough and relevant enough for the 100K users on the site. So this is what I added:

- An Upcoming Events block to alert users to any upcoming events or deadlines
- A custom HTML block with a few tips for users
- Visual links to add some color to the page
