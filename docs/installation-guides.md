# Installation Guides

## Installing eScriptorium on Debian

In March 2024, I set up an instance of an eScriptorium site as a personal project for a family member. eScriptorium is an open source application for handwritten text recognition. I figured out how to install the site on a cloud server by interviewing a project developer to fill in the gaps in my knowledge. In return, I wrote an installation guide and added it to an eScriptorium project wiki.

## Installing Moodle on Ubuntu

Moodle is an open source application for developing online learning environments, and it was a big part of my work for many years. Moodle installation guides are available on moodle.org, but they can be a little unpolished. I wrote my own installation guide, both as a documentation exercise and as a reference for my own installs in the early 2020s.
