Library Coordinator & Technical Communicator
{: .fs-6 .fw-300}

I work as the public services coordinator in the science and engineering libraries at Princeton University. I also teach a summer course in technical communication at Kyushu University. This site contains my portfolio, which I primarily use for teaching and demonstration.
